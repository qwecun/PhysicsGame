Question 1: What does " at rest" mean in reference to kinematics?
Initial Velocity = 0
Remain in motion
Maintain its mass 
The object is sleeping
Mass is equal to zero
Question 2: How can we make a car move when it is at rest? 
Apply acceleration
Adding oil
Call AAA
Getting a tow
Call a friend
Question 3: A car accelerates from rest to an acceleration of 20m/s^2 in 4 seconds.  Which formula should we use to solve the question
D = Vi*t + at^2/2
Vf = Vi + at
Vf^2 = Vi^2 + 2as
s = (Vi+ Vf)t/2
v = d / t
Question 4: A car acceleratees from rest to an acceleration of 20 m/s^2 in 4 seconds.  How far does the car travel?
160m
80m
120m
100m
60m
